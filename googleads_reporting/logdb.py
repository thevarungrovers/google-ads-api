"""The SQLite log database: every tool call, API call and mutation.

One file, ``logs/google-ads.db``, gitignored because the rows carry real
customer ids and campaign names. It replaces BOTH JSONL ledgers this repo used
to keep -- ``audit/mcp-changes.jsonl`` and ``audit/mutations-<date>.jsonl`` --
rather than sitting beside them.

WHY IT LIVES IN ``googleads_reporting`` AND NOT ``googleads_mcp``:
``googleads_mcp`` imports this package, not the other way round. The library's
own write path (``write/audit.py``) has to log too, so the module both of them
need belongs in the lower layer. Putting it in the server package would invert
the dependency and make the library unusable without the MCP server installed.

FOUR TABLES, and the relationships are the point:

    tool_calls   one row per MCP tool invocation, or one CLI command
    api_calls    one row per outbound call to Google, linked to the tool call
                 that caused it
    changes      what the MCP SERVER changed, with the before-value needed to
                 reverse it -- the ledger ``revert_change`` reads
    mutations    every mutation the LIBRARY sent from any caller, including
                 validate_only dry runs the changes table never sees

``changes`` and ``mutations`` are deliberately still two tables. They answer
different questions -- "what did the agent do that I might want to undo" versus
"what did this package send to Google" -- and a single table would have to
null out half its columns for whichever kind of row it was holding.

TWO ERROR POLICIES, DELIBERATELY DIFFERENT:

  - Observability writes (tool_calls, api_calls) NEVER raise. A bug in the
    logger must not turn a working tool into a failure, and the MCP server's
    stderr is invisible in normal use, so a logging error would be both fatal
    and silent.

  - Ledger writes (changes, mutations) DO raise. Since the JSONL was retired
    these tables are the only record of a real-money mutation, and what
    ``revert_change`` reads to undo one. Losing a row quietly is worse than
    failing the write that would have produced it.

TWO-PHASE, EXACTLY AS THE JSONL WAS: the intent row goes in BEFORE the request
leaves the process and the outcome is filled in after it returns. A row whose
outcome is unset is the dangerous one -- the write started and nothing recorded
how it ended, so it may well have landed at Google's end. That is an INSERT
followed by an UPDATE, never an upsert: in ``ON CONFLICT ... DO UPDATE``,
``excluded.col`` is the value that WOULD have been inserted, so a clause
written to preserve a column can silently overwrite it. Two statements cannot
express that bug.

CONCURRENCY. The MCP server is long-lived while ``scripts/manage.py`` runs in a
terminal, so two processes write here at once. WAL plus a busy timeout is what
makes that work; the default journal mode would hand the second writer
``database is locked``. ``synchronous=FULL`` because the ledger half of this
file is evidence, and the JSONL it replaced was fsync'd per record.
